## Data Availability
The RNA sequencing data that supported the findings of this study have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with Bio Project ID PRJNA914646. The metabolomics (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.29640338) and proteomics (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.29640458) data were deposited on Figshare. All processed proteomic, metabolomic, transcriptomic, miRNA, placental histopathology reports, and clinical [data](data/) used in these analyses are available on GitHub (https://github.com/spiekos/Hood-Lab-Placental-Multiomics/). This includes the data in the [raw](data/raw/), [cleaned](data/normalized_cleaned), and [adjusted](data/normalized_cleaned_adjusted) forms. The results of the cellular deconvolution analysis, [Supplementary Data](data/supplementary_data), and [condition-specific communities](output) are also made available.
